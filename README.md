## Currency converter app
Inspired by Florin Pop's [App Ideas Collection](https://github.com/florinpop17/app-ideas/blob/master/Projects/2-Intermediate/Currency-Converter.md). 

Built using Next.js/React + TypeScript
### User stories

- [] User can enter up to 9 digits to represent the amount to convert in a source input field  
- [] User can view a sorted list of available currencies and select the currency to convert from in a source drop-down list  
- [] User can view a sorted list of available currencies and select the currency to convert to in a destination drop-down list  
- [] User views the value (rounded to two decimal places) of the source amount converted to the destination currency in a single output field as soon as either the input value, the source currency, or the destination currency is changed.  
- [] User must be alerted if the input is not a number  

### Bonus features

- [] User should be able to swap the values of the source and destination drop-down lists on the click of a button

## Get started

To run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:6001](http://localhost:6001) with your browser to see the result.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new) from the creators of Next.js.
Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
